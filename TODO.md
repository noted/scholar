# To-Do

* Handle `nil`/`blank` arguments for `Formatters` (return `nil` instead of actually performing action).
* Do not modify source hash (if `Scholar::Citation.new(hash)` is run, `hash` should not change in current environment).
* Documentation of all classes and public methods.
* Test all the things.
